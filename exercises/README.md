# Starting exercises

Make a notebook and explore one of these three topics. Pease commit your notebook to the workshop repository before 12:00. Even if it is in a very preliminary/incomplete state, others can still learn from your work!

  1. Make your own **peak classification** plugin. Try different variables, different settings, or define some new ones. See how your new classification changes the final result (the events). Perhaps you'd like to focus on one type of peak in particular, or can you find peaks besides S1s/S2s?
  2. Use background data to derive an **electron lifetime**. Focus on data extraction, e.g. of the alpha peaks, and data cleaning, not the fitting/uncertainties. Do you see good agreement with the value in the runs db?
  3. A challenge for those who think A and B are too easy. Estimate the **half-life of Kr-83m**. You have limited statistics available, so make the best of the data you have. You you will almost certainly have to make one or more new plugins, and may want to play with some clustering settings to get more resolved S1s. Focus on data extraction and cleaning, not on fitting/uncertainties.
